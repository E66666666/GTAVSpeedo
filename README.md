GTA V Speedometer
=========================
*Yet another* speedometer! Since other speedo devs have been either unresponsive or unwilling to add stuff, and I myself want to have some stuff added, well, time for my own speedo.

## Requirements
* Grand Theft Auto V
* [ScriptHookV by Alexander Blade](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/)

## Downloads

* None yet

## Building

### Requirements
* [ScriptHookV SDK by Alexander Blade](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/)
* [GTAVMenuBase](https://github.com/E66666666/GTAVMenuBase)
* [GTAVManualTransmission](https://github.com/E66666666/GTAVManualTransmission)

Download the [ScriptHookV SDK](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) and extract its contents to ScriptHookV_SDK.

Clone this repository to the same folder ScriptHookV_SDK was extracted so you have ScriptHookV_SDK and GTAVManualTransmission in the same folder. If you get build errors about missing functions, update your [natives.h](http://www.dev-c.com/nativedb/natives.h). Check AppVeyor build logs for the natives.h I use.

Clone my [GTAVMenuBase](https://github.com/E66666666/GTAVMenuBase) to the same folder you're gonna clone this to.

Clone my [GTAVManualTransmission](https://github.com/E66666666/GTAVManualTransmission) to the same folder you're gonna clone this to. We're gonna need (some of) those extra vehicle natives.

## Decorators 'n stuff

Well, this is probably going to read stuff from my Manual Transmission mod.
